Ran with Python 2.7

Script can only be ran if current directory is holding the respective virus' strace out named as strace_output.

To produce the strace_output, please use run_strace.sh script.

To run the shell script to produce strace_output file:
example: ./run_strace.sh /Path/virusname

/Path/virusname is the location of the virus.
output will be in the working directory the user ran the script. In another words it will be in $PWD

To run the python script:

usage: python sys_ngrams_single_out.py /Path containing stace_output/ virus_name
Example: python ./home/sys_ngrams_single_out.py /Users/tristanleung/Desktop/ a7cc7869eba384d53a54c5ad14776fb7818280eaddbe8a8872a2252c3af4e50a
Output files will be in the directory where the strace_output is located.


***IMPORTANT:
3 grams data with zero vectors will contain a lot of information. The file size for the output will be more than 3GB. It is up to the users discretion to generate 3 grams or not. You may uncomment the functions that form the 3 grams dataset with zeroes.
